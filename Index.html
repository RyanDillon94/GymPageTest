                <strong>Hey! </strong><br><br>
                My names <strong>Ryan </strong>and I am a <strong>Business Analyst </strong>trying to learn <strong>HTML. </strong><br><br>
                I have decided to create this website as a project to test my HTML knowledge and hopefully help you get into shape!

            <h3>My weight loss journey</h3>
            <p>
                I used to be <strong>19 stone</strong>, lifting the same weights over and over week on week and getting zero progress.

                    I had been lifting weights for around 4 years but my body composition stayed the same and i lost <strong>zero </strong>weight. I decided <strong>enough was enough!</strong><br> I had wanted to start running for a while and instead of being sensible i went for my usual approach... <strong>all in or nothing!</strong> I signed up for a local half marathon and set myself on a mission to go from 0 miles to 13.1 within 6 months.
                </p>

            <div id="Running">
                <h3>So I started running</h3>
                <p>
                    With <strong>six months to go </strong>and <strong>zero running experience... </strong>I laced up my trainers,
                    charged up my earphones and started the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/get-running-with-couch-to-5k/">
                        Couch
                        to 5k
                    </a>. Within 9 weeks i recorded my <strong>first 5k </strong>with a time of <strong>42 minutes and 39 seconds.</strong>
                </p>

            </div>
            <h3>My first Half Marathon</h3>
            <p>I completed the Couch to 5k and kept up with the regular running, increasing my distance through a weekly long run and before i knew it... Race Day was here!</p>
            <img src="hm4.jpg" width="300" title="First Half 1" alt="First Half 1" />
            <img src="hm2.jpg" width="300" title="First Half 2" alt="First Half 2" />
            <img src="hm1.jpg" width="300" title="First Half 3" alt="First Half 3" />
            <img src="hm3.jpg" width="300" title="First Half 4" alt="First Half 4" />
            <p>It took me 2 hours and 53 minutes, <strong>but i had done it...</strong> my first Half Marathon was complete, and i had caught the bug!</p><br />
            <p>
                I signed up for the Great North Run and set my sights on getting <strong>faster</strong>.<br />
                I didnt structure my running at all. I had a goal but <strong>no plan</strong> of how to get there, i just ran 3-4 times per week and <strong>enjoyed every second</strong> of it!
            </p>
            <h3>I had lost weight...</h3>
            <p>
                Not much, but I had <strong>lost enough</strong> for it to be <strong>noticable.</strong> <br />
                I had signed up for a number of 10ks and the Great North Run every year since 2018 and decided to make a comparison photo...
            </p>
            <img src="Comparison.jpg" title="Comparison" alt="Comparison Photo" />
            <p>
                I began to look like <strong>i actually enjoyed it!</strong><br />
                I began to train properly, including Speed workouts and Hill sprints (<em>more of this on my Running page</em>). I managed to get my times down and i am not going to stop there.
                My current Personal Bests are:
            </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>5k</td>
                    <td>10k</td>
                    <td>Half Marathon</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>24:44</td>
                        <td>51:03</td>
                        <td>2:04:40</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            <p>2024 will be the year that i break the 50 minute 10k and the 2 hour Half Marathon... <strong>I'll make sure of it!</strong></p>
